	"about": [
		"You guessed it. My name is Colette! I like to think small and dream big by considering emergent processes in technical and visual design. What does this mean? To plan and iterate while exploring both the small details and the bigger picture. After all, like Checkhovâ€™s Gun, the small stuff is what makes the big picture all the more fascinating.",
		"I was always described as artistic and technically savvy in grade school, and my love of the arts, as well as my interest in computer science and business, led me to explore a career in digital design. From 2011 to 2014, I attended the University of Wyoming and received a Bachelors of Arts in Honors and Art with a Graphic Design emphasis. While in college, I developed my abilities in photography, printmaking, and drawing, which furthered my understanding of the art and design world as a whole. I also worked as a graphic and web designer for the Wyoming Union, designing dozens of posters and additional promotional material for community events on campus, and as a 3D modeling intern for the School of Energy Resources, creating virtual objects and buildings to display in a three dimensional rendering of campus.",
		"After graduating, I interned and contracted as a web designer, web developer, production artist, and interactive designer in Denver and Boulder for School Datebooks, MDC Holdings, Metzger Albee Public Relations, and Starz Entertainment. I recently completed a Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology with a Web Design and Development emphasis through the University of Denver's University College program, and currently work in Boston as a web developer for New England Sports Network."
