		"Hi there! My name is Colette, welcome to my portfolio site! I am a digital engineer with a design background specializing in visualization, interactivity, and front-end programming.",
		"I was always described as artistic and technically savvy in grade school, and my love of the arts, as well as my interest in computer science and business, led me to explore a career in digital design. I attended the University of Wyoming and received a Bachelors of Arts with a Graphic Design emphasis, where I developed my abilities in art and design.",
		"Curious about how websites and other user interfaces worked in addition to how they looked and felt, I chose to hybridize my career as a designer by learning more about web programming. After graduating, I interned and contracted as a web designer, web developer, production artist, and interactive designer in Denver. I then worked full time in Boston as a web designer and developer while completing a Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology through the University of Denver.",
		"Over the years, my interests in digital user interfaces and their varying levels of complexity have evolved, leading me to a current emphasis in data visualization and mapping and how these interface types relate to the human learning experience. My most recent professional experience revolves around building data visualization components in React."
